 CNN (ResNet-50, pre-trained on ImageNet) was integrated  to isolate corneal regions in anterior segment photographs. The model, implemented in PyTorch with NumPy, optimized weights and biases using stochastic gradient descent (learning rate: 0.001) and backpropagation. A dataset of 831 annotated images (healthy and infected corneas) was augmented through multiple methods. Performance was evaluated on a test set for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. An app incorporating the fine tuned model was built, allowing users to take pictures of their own eyes and obtain real time diagnosis. 


A trained fined tuned model was obtained through the training process. When testing with a test set representing 20 % of the total availabl3e sample size, with an equivalent number of images per class, the model achieved a prediction accuracy of 91 % when identifying cases of infectious keratitis, 72 % when identifying epiphora and healthy eyes. Overall, the model achieved an accuracy of 84 % on the entire testing. The limited amount of data available to the study limited the model's performance, as the image sample size was to small, and the images sourced were homogenous, with little diversity. The  

The AI system, integrating ResNet-50, GANs, and U-Net segmentation, achieved 84% overall accuracy on a test set (20% of 831 images, balanced classes). It detected infectious keratitis with 91% accuracy and epiphora/healthy eyes with 72% accuracy. GAN-based augmentation enhanced the dataset, addressing the limited 831-image sample size. The model, optimized with stochastic gradient descent (learning rate: 0.001) and backpropagation,
